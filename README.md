# Stargazers
## MERN Project
### Introduction
Stargazers website is a place for astronomy and space lovers to enjoy stargazing and star-camping events, and share their interests with other astronomy fans. The website allows individuals and institutions to create stargazing and star-camping events for educational, research and/or entertainment purposes. It’s a hub for all astronomy fans and learners to have access to all related space events and be able to book the ones that suit them based on location, date and type of astronomical phenomenon to observe. Users can also enjoy daily astronomy pictures provided by NASA APIs for images and information.
